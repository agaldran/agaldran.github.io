<p><strong>NOTE: This tutorial is under construction</strong></p>

<p>This year we have decided to move from Matlab to Python for the practical sessions.
Some of you maybe will not have worked with this programming language.
This first lecture is intended to guide you through your first steps in this programming language,
and make you aware of the (super-rich) Python ecosystem for scientific computing.</p>

<p>I really hope that by the end of this course you will be a Python fan, and consider abandoning Matlab once and forever!
This is an overview of what you will be learning today:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Motivation and Goals. What is Python?</strong></p></li>

<li><p><strong>Python Installation. Accompanying Tools</strong></p></li>

<li><p><strong>A Quick Introduction to the Python Programming Language</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Data Types</li>
<li>Python Operators</li>

<li>Python Variables and Functions</li>
<li>Python Objects and Classes</li>
<li>Modules and Packages</li>
</ol></li>

<li><p><strong>Complementary Python Scientific Computing Tools</strong></p></li>

<li><p><strong>Homework ðŸ˜±</strong></p></li>

<li><p><strong>Sources and References</strong></p></li>
</ol>

<p>So&hellip; let&rsquo;s move on.</p>

<h2 id="1-motivation-and-goals-what-is-python">1.- <strong>Motivation and Goals. What is Python?</strong></h2>

<p>First thing, Python is <strong>free</strong>. Second, it is <strong>simple</strong>.
Third, it is increasingly becoming the tool of choice for data science projects.
Fourth, it&rsquo;s multi-platform, it can run in Windows, Linux, Mac, your mobile phone&hellip;
And last, there is a <strong>huge</strong> community of contributors to lots of open-source projects that complement it.
This manifests in the form of a large ecosystem of scientific computing tools that grow along with the number of users.</p>

<p>However, to add all this to your tool-belt, the first step is to familiarize yourself with the Python language itself.
Today we will quickly review the main notions to get started on it.</p>

<p>But first, let us install Python!</p>

<h2 id="2-python-installation-accompanying-tools">2. <strong>Python Installation. Accompanying tools</strong></h2>

<h3 id="2-1-anaconda-python-distribution">2.1 Anaconda Python Distribution</h3>

<p>In this course we will use the Python language programming.
However, as mentioned above, one of the main strengths of Python is the large amount of available scientific libraries.
This means that, together with the core Python language, we&rsquo;ll be using several Python packages to perform scientific computations.
But instead of installing all these packages manually one at a time, we will be using a <strong>Python distribution</strong>.
A distribution consists of the core Python package and several hundred modules, and available through a single download and installation.
In this course, we will use the Anaconda Python distribution.
Apart of Python itself and several hundred libraries, Anaconda also includes two very useful development environments: <strong>Jupyter</strong> and <strong>Spyder</strong>.
More on this below.</p>

<div class="alert alert-note">
  <p>The Anaconda Python distribution can be found <a href="https://www.continuum.io/downloads" target="_blank">here</a>. Please install the Python 3.</p>

</div>


<div class="alert alert-warning">
  <p>Questions for the slide/quizzes:
a) Python has two operating modes. Which are they?
Interactive mode
Standard mode
Both of the above - correct
None of the above</p>

<p>b) Which version of Python will we focus on in this course?
Python 2
Python 3 - correct
Spyder
Jupyter</p>

</div>


<h3 id="2-2-executing-python-code">2.2  Executing Python code</h3>

<p>Python has two different modes: <strong>interactive</strong> and <strong>standard</strong>.
The interactive mode is meant for experimenting your code one line or one expression at a time.
The standard mode is useful for running programs from start to finish.
You will probably find yourself alternating between both modes.</p>

<h4 id="2-2-1-python-interactive-mode">2.2.1 Python Interactive Mode</h4>

<p>For a first example on interactive mode, open a command console, type <code>python</code>, and you will start using Python. Experiment a bit.</p>

<p>A more convenient way of building code interactively is through <strong>iPython notebooks - Jupyter</strong>.
This also allows us to mix text, code, and maths, which is really cool.
To start an iPython notebook, open a console, type jupyter notebook, and navigate in your browser to localhost/whatever.
Explanations on ipython.</p>

<h4 id="2-2-2-python-standard-mode">2.2.2 Python Standard Mode</h4>

<p>In this case, we write a text file with Python instructions, and run it. <code>hello_world.py</code>.</p>

<p>Again, there is a more convenient way for building code in standard mode, which is using an <strong>IDE</strong> (Integrated Development Environment).
This programming tool will allow you to more easily debug, inspect variables, and quickly modify your code.
They typically also include an embedded interactive system. An example of an IDE is <strong>Spyder</strong>, already contained in the Anaconda distribution.</p>

<div class="alert alert-note">
  <p>For the contents of this lecture, starting from Section 3, a notebook version of this lecture is available <strong>HERE</strong> &ndash; still not. Open it!</p>

</div>


<h2 id="3-introduction-to-the-python-programming-language">3. <strong>Introduction to the Python Programming Language</strong></h2>

<h3 id="3-1-fundamental-python-data-types">3.1 - Fundamental Python data types</h3>

<p>Python contains several typical built-in data types as part of the core language.
The same as in e.g Matlab (and different from e.g. C) you do not need to explicitly declare the type of a variable.
Python determines data type of variables by how they are used.</p>

<p>For instance, to create an integer (<code>int</code>) variable you simply type:</p>

<pre><code class="language-python"># An integer variable a
a = 5
print(type(a))
</code></pre>

<p>Other basic/common python types are for instance<code>float</code>, <code>string</code>, or <code>boolean</code>, exemplified below:</p>

<pre><code class="language-python"># A float variable f
f = 5.0
# A boolean
b = True
# A string
c = 'bom dia'
</code></pre>

<h3 id="3-2-everything-is-an-object">3.2 - Everything is an object</h3>

<p>It is important that you start thinking of the above examples <code>a,f,b,c</code> as <strong>objects</strong>.
Each object in Python has three characteristics: object <strong>type</strong>, object <strong>value</strong>, and object <strong>identity</strong>.
Object type tells Python what kind of an object it&rsquo;s dealing with.
A type could be a number, or a string, or a list, or something else.
Object value is the data value is contained by the object.
This could be a specific number, for example.
Finally, you can think of object identity as an identity number for the object.
Each distinct object in the computer&rsquo;s memory will have its own identity number.</p>

<div class="alert alert-warning">
  <p>Questions for the slide/quizzes:
Consider the following line of code:
x = 4
In this assignment, what does the number 4 represent?
The object type.
The object value. correct
The object identity.</p>

</div>


<p>Most Python objects have either data or functions or both associated with them.
These are known as attributes.
The name of the attribute follows the name of the object.
And these two are separated by a dot in between them.
The two types of attributes are called either data attributes or methods.
A data attribute is a value that is attached to a specific object.
In contrast, a method is a function that is attached to an object.
And typically a method performs some function
or some operation on that object.
Object type always determines the kind of operations that it supports.
In other words, depending on the type of the object,
different methods may be available to you as a programmer.
Finally, an instance is one occurrence of an object.
For example, you could have two strings.
They may have different values stored in them,
but they nevertheless support the same set of methods.</p>

<h3 id="3-3-python-modules">3.3 - Python Modules</h3>

<p>Python contains builtin functions, such as <code>print</code> that can be used by all Python programs.
However, while the Python library consists of all core elements, such as data types and built-in functions,
the bulk of the Python library consists of modules.
In order for you to be able to make use of modules in your own code,
you first need to import those modules using the import statement.</p>

<p><strong>Example of modules, attributes, methods, in numpy.</strong></p>

<p>The numpy example above made available some specific data types and methods for us.
This is an example of a <strong>Python module</strong>.
In general, Python modules are libraries of code that you import and use through <code>import</code> statements.
Let&rsquo;s go through a simple example. Import the <code>math</code> module.
This module gives you access to the pi constant. Print its value.
This module also gives you access to several mathematical operations. Find out (print) the value of the sine of pi.</p>

<div class="alert alert-note">
  <p>If you only need, e.g., the value of pi from the entire <code>math</code> module, you can import it selectively:</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">from math import pi
print(pi)
</code></pre>

</div>


<h3 id="3-4-python-basic-operators">3.4 - Python Basic Operators:</h3>

<p>Operators are symbols that allow you to use logic and arithmetic in your computations.
Python has several operators, the most prominent ones being <strong>arithmetic</strong>, <strong>comparison</strong>, and <strong>logical</strong>.</p>

<h4 id="3-4-1-arithmetic-operators">3.4.1 - Arithmetic operators:</h4>

<p>They will take two variables and perform simple mathematical operations on them.
They are addition <code>+</code>, subtraction <code>-</code>, multiplication <code>*</code>, division <code>/</code>, modulus <code>%</code>, floor division <code>//</code>, and exponentiation <code>**</code></p>

<pre><code class="language-python">print(3+2, 3-2, 3*2, 3/2, 3%2, 3//2, 3**2)
</code></pre>

<h4 id="3-4-2-comparison-operators">3.4.2 - Comparison operators:</h4>

<p>They observe two variables and return a boolean value.
They are the usual greater than (<code>&gt;</code>,<code>&gt;=</code>), equal (<code>=</code>), different (<code>!=</code>), and lower than (<code>&lt;</code>,<code>&lt;=</code>) mathematical operators.</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">print(3&gt;2, 3&lt;2, 3==2, 3!=2, 3&gt;=2, 3&lt;=2)
</code></pre>

<h4 id="3-4-3-logical-operators">3.4.3 - Logical operators:</h4>

<p>These operators will interpret their input as boolean values, and return a boolean value depending on the truth value of both inputs.
They are <code>and</code>, <code>or</code>, <code>not</code>.</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">print(True and True, False or False, not True)
</code></pre>

<h4 id="3-4-5-other-operators">3.4.5 - Other operators</h4>

<p>There are other operators in Python, such as identity (<code>is</code>, <code>is not</code>) or membership (<code>in</code>, <code>not in</code>).
I am 100% sure you will be able to guess what is their effect on variables/containers!
<div class="alert alert-note">
  <p>Note this subtle difference between <code>==</code> and <code>is</code>: <code>==</code> tests whether objects have the same value, whereas <code>is</code>
tests whether objects have the same identity. Try it with <code>a=[1,2]</code> and <code>b=[1,2]</code>.</p>

</div>
</p>

<h3 id="3-5-sequences-and-object-containers">3.5 - Sequences and Object Containers</h3>

<h4 id="3-5-1-python-sequences">3.5.1 - Python Sequences</h4>

<p>A sequence is an <strong>ordered</strong> collection of objects. In Python, you can find three types of sequences: Lists, Tuples, and Range Objects.</p>

<p>Let us focus on the first two of them. Lists and tuples can be accessed by indexing and can be sliced in several ways:</p>

<pre><code class="language-python"># A tuple
t = (0,True)
# A list l
l = [0,True]
</code></pre>

<p>Note that there is a relevant difference between tuples and lists: tuples are <strong>immutable</strong>, while lists are not.
This means that you won&rsquo;t be able to modify the content stored at <code>t</code>. We will explain this in a second.
Note also that both lists and tuples allow you to mix different data types.</p>

<h4 id="note-mutable-and-immutable-objects">Note: Mutable and immutable objects</h4>

<p>The value of some objects can change in the course of program execution.
Objects whose value can change are said to be mutable objects,
whereas objects whose value is unchangeable after they&rsquo;ve been created
are called immutable.</p>

<div class="alert alert-warning">
  <p>Questions for the slide/quizzes:
What does it mean for an object to be immutable?
Its contents cannot be modified by the programmer.
Its contents cannot be modified by the programmer after the object has been created. correct</p>

</div>


<p>Continuing with sequences, in order to access the elements that a tuple/list holds, you use <strong>square brackets, not parenthesis</strong>:</p>

<pre><code class="language-python"># the first element of the tuple t
t_first = t[0]
</code></pre>

<p>Also note that, the same as e.g. C (and different from e.g. Matlab), <strong>in Python indexing starts at 0</strong>.
Be careful with this, because it is a common source of confusion in the beginning.</p>

<div class="alert alert-warning">
  <p>Questions for the slide/quizzes:
Consider the following tuple and index (1,2,3)[0]. What will this return?
0
1
3
This code contains an error.</p>

</div>


<p>Sequences can be accessed by indexing, which supports negatives indexes:</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">t = (0,1,'hola',3,4.0)
l = [0,1,'hola',3,4.0]
print(t[0])
print(t[-1]) # note the behavior of negative indexes
print(t[0:2]) # slicing first two elements, third is excluded
print(l[2:5]) # slicing last three elements
print(l[2:]) # empty spot after : means up to length-of-list index
print(l[:2]) # empty spot before : means from first index
print(l[0:5:2]) # every element, but use a step size of 2
</code></pre>

<div class="alert alert-warning">
  <p>Questions for the slide/quizzes:
Consider the following tuple and index (1,2,3)[0:-1]. What will this return?
(1,2) correct
(2)
()
This code contains an error.
Python includes all values from the beginning of the first index in the slice up to and not including the second value in the slice</p>

</div>


<p>Sequences also support a very handy operation called <strong>slicing</strong>, that enables access to multiple objects at the same time:</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">print(t[0:2]) # slicing first two elements, third is excluded
print(l[2:5]) # slicing last three elements
print(l[2:]) # empty spot after : means up to length-of-list index
print(l[:2]) # empty spot before : means from first index
print(l[0:5:2]) # every element, but use a step size of 2
</code></pre>

<div class="alert alert-warning">
  <p>Questions for the slide/quizzes:
Consider the following tuple and index (1,2,3)[1:1]. What will this return?
(0)
(1)
() correct
This code contains an error.
Python includes all values from the beginning of the first index in the slice up to and not including the second value in the slice</p>

</div>


<p>Tuples and lists, as every python object, have several methods that you can use with them.
However, since lists are mutable, they have methods that can modify their content:</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">a = [4,3,2,1]
a.append(5)
print(a)
a.sort()
print(a)
</code></pre>

<p>Note that list methods are <strong>in-place methods</strong>, they modify the original object that called them and return nothing.
For a complete list of these, see <a href="http://faculty.salina.k-state.edu/tim/NPstudy_guide/python/containers.html#list-methods" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p>There are other generic Python functions that work with sequences and provide useful operations:</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">a = [4,3,2,1]
b = sorted(a)
n = len(b)
s = sum(a)
print(b, n, s)
</code></pre>

<h4 id="3-5-2-object-containers-dictionaries">3.5.2 - Object Containers: Dictionaries</h4>

<p>Sequences are a particularly simple example of Object Containers.
More generally, Python offers several more advanced object containers. A really useful one are dictionaries.</p>

<p>Dictionaries are <strong>unordered sequences</strong> that associate key objects to value objects.
This means that a dictionary consists of <strong>Key:Value</strong> pairs, and the keys must be immutable while the values can be anything.
Note that dictionaries themselves are mutable objects.</p>

<p>A dictionary is built with curly braces as follows:</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">ages = {&quot;Me&quot;: 33, &quot;You&quot;: 22, &quot;Him&quot;:24}
</code></pre>

<p>If now I want to know your age, and then increase it, I would type:</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">print(ages[&quot;You&quot;])
ages[&quot;You&quot;] += 1
print(ages[&quot;You&quot;])
</code></pre>

<p>You can add new items to your dictionary as follows:</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">ages[&quot;Her&quot;] = 20
print(ages)
</code></pre>

<p>Dictionary objects have also their own methods.
For instance, you can use <code>keys</code> to find out what are all the keys in the dictionary, or the <code>values</code> method
to retrieve are all of the values in the dictionary:</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">names = ages.keys()
years = ages.values()
</code></pre>

<div class="alert alert-warning">
  <p>REWRITE THIS BELOW!</p>

</div>


<p>Objects in Python are composed by their name, their content, and a reference that points the name to the content.
When an object is created, Python tells your computer to reserve memory locations to store the corresponding data.
Depending on the data type of a variable, the interpreter allocates a certain amount of memory.</p>

<p>As we have seen above, in Python, there is no need of declaring objects nor their type before using them.
This is because actually what you are doing is not creating a spot in memory and filling it with an object.
Rather, you are creating a pointer (that occupies a first memory spot), and then making that pointer point to an object in a second memory spot.
For this reason, you can for instance reassign a variable to a different type of object without errors:</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">a = [0,1,2]
a = (-1,3)
a = True
</code></pre>

<p>Note that when you assign a variable to another, you are just creating a second pointer to that same memory spot.</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">a = [0,1,2]
b = a
b[2] = 0
print(a)

<h3 id="3-8-python-functions">3.8 Python Functions</h3>

<p>Being only able to ``interactively&rdquo; play with variables is boring.
To build more complex code, we need functions.
Functions are tools for grouping statements so that they can be executed more than once in the same program.
They are useful maximize code reuse and minimize code redundancy, therefore contributing to avoid errors.</p>

<p>Functions are written using the <code>def</code> statement.
You can send objects created inside your function back to where it was called with the <code>return</code> statement.</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">def compute_sum(a,b):
    c = a+b
    return c
</code></pre>

<p>To use this function, we simply call it passing appropriate parameters:</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">a = 5
b = -2
print(compute_sum(a,b))
</code></pre>

<p>Arguments to Python functions are matched by position.
Tuples are typically used to return multiple values.
Note that functions themselves are objects:</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">print(type(compute_sum))
</code></pre>

<p>In general, variables created or assigned in a function are local of that function and exist only while the function runs.</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">L = [0,1,2]
def modify(my_list):
    c = 3
    my_list[0] += 20
modify(L)
print(L)
print(c)
</code></pre>

<p>It is also possible to specify a default value for some argument:</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">def compute_sum(a,b=2)
    c = a+b
    return c
</code></pre>

<p>Likewise, you can have keyword arguments, specified by name:</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">print(1,2, sep=';')
</code></pre>

<p>Keyword arguments must always go behind non-keyword arguments.</p>

<p>When you want to have a function with an undetermined number of arguments, you can use <code>*args</code> and <code>**kwargs</code>.</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">def print_all(*args, **kwargs):
    print(&quot;arguments = &quot;, args)
    print(&quot;keyword arguments = &quot;, kwargs)
</code></pre>

<p>This is useful to pass lists and dictionaries to a function. More in the homework.

1.- Create a function that takes as arguments two lists <code>l1</code> and <code>l2</code>, and returns a new list containing the elements that were both in <code>l1</code> and <code>l2</code>.</p>

<p>Hint: You can do this by looping over the elements of <code>l1</code> (<code>for</code>), checking if they are in <code>l2</code> (<code>if</code>), in which case you would add them to a list you would finally return (<code>append</code>).</p>

<p>2.- Consider the following function</p>

<p>What value will <code>my_cum_sum(5)</code> return?</p>

<p>3.- Recall that n! (&ldquo;n factorial&rdquo;) is defined as the product of all integers 1,&hellip;,n. Additionally, by definition, 0! = 1.
Create a factorial function that has as input an integer, and returns its factorial.</p>

<p>Hint: There are several ways to solve this.
The simplest one is: check if the input is 0, in which case you return 1. Otherwise, start by N=1, loop from 1 to the input and update the result.</p>

<p>4.- We are going to count the frequency of each letter in a given string.</p>

<p>4.1) import the <code>string</code> library.
Now create a variable <code>alphabet</code> that consists of the lowercase and uppercase letters in the English alphabet. For this,
use the <code>ascii_letters</code> attribute of the string library.</p>

<p>4.2) Now, consider the sentence &lsquo;Jim quickly realized that the beautiful gowns are expensive&rsquo;.
Create a dictionary <code>count_letters</code> with keys consisting of each unique letter in the sentence and values consisting of
the number of times each letter is used in this sentence.
Count both upper case and lower case letters separately in the dictionary.</p>

<p>Hint: You can loop (<code>for</code>) over each letter in your sentence, check (<code>if</code>) if the letter is already among your dictionary keys, and otherwise, update your dictionary with a new key.
For that, you can count the number of occurrences with the method <code>count</code>, which you can look up in google.
Do not forget to omit the blank space in <code>sentence</code>!</p>

<p>4.3) Use the code you built in 4.2) to create a function called <code>counter</code> that takes a string <code>input_string</code> and returns
a dictionary of letter counts <code>count_letters</code>. Test it with <code>sentence</code>.</p>

<p>4.4) Use the dictionary created by your function to find out and print the most frequent letter in <code>sentence</code>.</p>

<p>5.- The distance between two points <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> is the square root of the sum of squared differences along each dimension of <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>.
Build a function <code>distance(x, y)</code> that takes two vectors and outputs the distance between them.
Use your function to find the distance between <code>x=(0,0)</code> and <code>y=(1,1)</code>, and between <code>x=(0,0,0)</code> and <code>y=(1,1,1)</code></p>

<h3 id="3-9-classes-and-object-oriented-programming">3.9 Classes and Object-Oriented Programming</h3>

<p>How can you go beyond built-in data types and create new object types, with their
associated methods and attributes defined by you?
Python allows you to create new classes, and then define (<em>instantiate</em>)
new objects of that class and interact with them. This way, you can
group data and functions operating on it in a more abstract way, and
then instantiate concrete samples and use them.
Classes allow for a simplified modeling of our problems, and enables the
creation of cleaner code that will be more easily extended in the future.</p>

<div class="alert alert-note">
  <p>When dealing with classes, data is usually called <em>attributes</em>, and functions <em>methods</em>.</p>

</div>


<h4 id="3-9-2-building-a-new-class-from-scratch">3.9.2 - Building a new Class from scratch</h4>

<p>Every class needs to have a special method, called <code>constructor</code>, that initializes its attributes.</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">class Y:
    def __init__(self, v0):
        self.v0 = v0
        self.g = 9.81
</code></pre>

<p>You will note the presence of the <code>self</code> parameter: this is a special inner
reference to the object state. It may take some time to understand the use
of <code>self</code>, but do not be afraid, we will see some examples afterwards.</p>

<p>As it stands, an object of the <code>Y</code> class has very limited value, as it contains only data (attributes).
Let us add some spice by giving our class a function (method):</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">class Y:
    def __init__(self, v0):
        self.v0 = v0
        self.g = 9.81
    def value(self, t):
        return self.v0 * t - 0.5*self.g*t**2
</code></pre>

<p>The utility of <code>self</code> starts to become clear now. At this point, you have
created a useful class, and you can instantiate an object of this new type easily:</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">y = Y(3)
print(type(y))
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, we call our class as if it was a normal Python function, and Python
automatically invokes the constructor method. <code>__init__</code> requires a parameter to be specified
at instantiation time, in this case <code>3</code>. If you do not specify it, you will get an error.</p>

<p>Now, attributes and methods are exposed to the user:</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">print(y.v0)
print(y.g)
print(y.value(t=0.1)
</code></pre>

<p>How can you add new methods to your class? Let us add a <code>formula</code> method
that print the mathematical function used to compute <code>value</code>. This method
does not need input parameters, and outputs a string:</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">class Y:
    def __init__(self, v0):
        self.v0 = v0
        self.g = 9.81
    def value(self, t):
        return self.v0 * t - 0.5*self.g*t**2
    def print_formula(self):
        return â€™v0*t - 0.5*g*t**2; v0=%gâ€™ % self.v0
</code></pre>

<p>Note that even if the formula method does not need any arguments, we still
must add the <code>self</code> argument so that it can access the <code>v0</code> attribute.
This is omitted in the method call.</p>

<p>We know an object consists of both internal data and methods that perform operations on the data.
At some point you may find that existing object types do not fully suit your needs.
Classes are the tool that allows you to create new types of objects.</p>

<h4 id="3-9-2-class-inheritance">3.9.2 - Class Inheritance</h4>

<p>Sometimes, even if you have the need for a new type, it may happen that this new object type resembles,
in some way, an existing one.
Classes have the ability to inherit from other classes, and this is a fundamental aspect of OOP.</p>

<p>Let us see an example of how to build a new class, inheriting from the built-in Python <code>list</code> class.
We will add more functionality to it.</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">class MyList(list):
</code></pre>

<p>this definition ensure that our new class, derived from <code>list</code>, will inherit the attributes of the base class.
However, now we can extend, or redefine those attributes!</p>

<p>For instance, we are going to improve the built-in <code>remove</code> methods, implemented by Python for lists in this way:</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">L = [0,1,2,5,5]
L.remove(5)
</code></pre>

<p>We will add new methods to also be able to remove the maximum and minimum element of a list.
For this, we complete the definition of our extended class as follows:</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">class MyList(list):
    def remove_min(self):
        self.remove(min(self))
    def remove_max(self):
        self.remove(max(self))
</code></pre>

<p>Now we can make use of our class:</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">L2 = MyList(L)
dir(L)
dir(L2)
print(L2.remove_min())
</code></pre>
